        <h1>Explaining Broadcast Anonymous Routing (BAR) in 5'</h1>
        <h3>What is Broadcast Anonymous Routing?</h3>
        <p>Broadcast Anonymous Routing (BAR) is a system that provides strong
        anonymity for both the sender and the receiver of a message. In addition to
        that, it makes it difficult for other parties to distinguish if BAR users are
        actually communicating or not! These anonymity properties are not possible
        through other anonymous channels based only on traditional onion routing.
        However, communication through the BAR requires from the users more bandwidth
        than traditional anonymous communication systems.</p>

        <h3>Can you explain broadcast anonymity in a simple manner?</h3>
        <p>Imagine Alice and Bob sitting in a crowded bar. Apart from Alice and
        Bob there are people standing between them and having their drinks. The
        bartender is willing to serve everyone around.

        Alice wants to communicate anonymously with Bob. She doesn't want anybody in the
        bar to know that she communicated with Bob and of course to hide the contents of
        her message. She can't just go there and talk to him because everyone will
        notice.</p>
                
        <p>What can Alice do?</p>
        <img src="bar1.png"></img>
        <h3>What can she do?</h3>

        <p>Alice writes a message for every customer in the bar and puts each
        message to a different envelop. Only Bob's message is real; all the other are
        "dummy" messages. She then hands the envelopes to the bartender along with
        specific directions.  </p>

        <img src="bar2.png"></img>

        <h3>What happens next?</h3>

        <p>Everybody will read a dummy message from Alice, except from Bob, the actual
        receiver.</p>

        <p>Now people will be able to see that Alice communicated with someone in the
        bar, but they cannot deduce that Bob was the actual receiver. Everyone got a
        message from Alice! Even the bartender himself cannot tell who the receiver is.
        Users can find the actual receiver, unless all of them cooperate to find this.
        That's it, Bob is an anonymous receiver!</p>

        <img src="bar3.png"></img>

        <h3>OK, I can see that Bob is anonymous, but I don't think that Alice really is.</h3>

        <p>BAR utilizes a couple of improvements in the basic version, to make
        Alice (the sender) anonymous. In the actual BAR protocol, Alice uses a random
        path of users, in order to handoff the message to the user for broadcasting. All
        the users have random keys in order to hide the routing path of Alice to the
        bartender (imagine something like Tor, with public keys dynamically updated for
        each user during his next login).</p>

        <h3>You said that others cannot even distinguish if Alice (and Bob) are actually communicating or not.</h3>

        <p>This is an advanced anonymity property known as sender-receiver
        anonymity. BAR achieves this because all BAR users are programmed to
        continuously handoff messages of constant length and size and at constant time
        slots to the bartender (the broadcast server). If some users do not want to
        communicate at a giver slot, they will simply handoff to the bartender fake
        messages of the proper length.  In this way, no one can tell if users of the
        system are actually communicating or not!</p>

        <h3>Ok i think i got it but it is kind of messy with a lot of broadcast messages send and received. Will it work in computer networks?</h3>

        <p>We need a BAR server acting as the bartender to broadcast messages to others,
        in the network.</p>

        <p>Alice will not actually handoff a different message in each slot but the same
        message is forwarded to the BAR server. Before sending the message, she encrypts
        it with an AES key shared with Bob, so that only Bob can decrypt.</p>

        <p>She also shares a secret label with Bob and she appends this label to the
        message. Now the receivers don't have to decrypt each broadcast message; each
        user checks the non-encrypted label to filter if the message is intended for
        them, before actually attempting decryption! Messages with unkown labels are
        simply dropped by each receiver. Note that each label is for one use only and it
        is updated within each exchanged encrypted message.</p>

        <h3>That's nice, but I can still think of some problems. How many users can a BAR server handle?</h3>
        <p>In the basic version of the BAR protocol, there are several limitations
        like:</p>

            <ul> <li>A system with a single BAR server can only handle up to some
        hundreds of users. We need more BARs if the number of users exceeds a
        limit. We also need a way to make users from different BARs to
        communicate with each other.</li> <li>The system is not distributed. The BAR
        server is a single point of failure.</li> <li>If the BAR server is curious and
        it cooperates with one endpoint that is also curious, they can expose the other
        endpoint.</li> </ul> <p>We are aware of these issues. Please note that most of
        them have been tackled in the extended BAR protocol published in the BAR
        paper.</p>
        <h3>How does BAR differs from other anonymity networks like Tor or I2P?</h3>
        <p>BAR has its advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other
        well-known anonymity networks. BAR provides stronger anonymity and is effective
        against a passive global adversary that performs some powerful attacks, like
        brute force or timing attacks while the other low-latency networks are not. It
        is also relatively easy to set up and deploy your own anonymous system using BAR
        since the broadcast mechanism is pretty straightforward. Finally BAR also
        provides low end-to-end latency for real time communications, as other
        networks.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, note that BAR requires additional communication bandwidth
        from each user. In short, within BAR you can gain stronger anonymity against
        attacks which are known to be effective in other anonymity networks, but this
        will cost you a few Mbps of your bandwidth.</p>

        <h3>Can i use it?</h3>
        <p>There is a minimal implementation of BAR on <a
        href="https://github.com/sophron/BAR">Github</a> serving as a
        proof of concept. You can use it at your own risk. Installation notes lie 
        <a href="install.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>I want to help!</h3>
        <p>Your help is very welcomed! We continuously have a need for testers,
        reviewers and developers. Don't hesitate to reach us.</p>
