BAR (Broadcast Anonymous Routing) is a practical and scalable system that can provide anonymous, real-time Internet communications against powerful adversaries. It is a hybrid system and makes use by employing both dc-net characteristics (broadcasting) and mix-net characteristics (layers of encryption).
