Broadcast Anonymous Routing - A scalable system for efficient anonymous communications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BAR system is based on a publicly accessible application-layer broadcast router, namely the Broadcast Anonymous Router or the BAR server. Registered users can login to the BAR to anonymously send an encrypted message to a potential receiver who will be able to efficiently filter out noise messages, receive and decrypt the actual message.

This is a very minimal implementation of BAR on Github. You can use it at your own risk.
